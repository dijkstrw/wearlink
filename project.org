* Interface to SSOP-18
** TC2030-STK
   Microchip cables that translate to small footprint pads on a pcb.

* Measurements of coat
  Setup:
  - 2.5mm female trs
    T = yellow
    R = red
    S = blue
  - 2.5mm male trs
    T = yellow
    R = white
    S = blue
** Resistance
   Connect F 2.5mmTRS to male 2.5mm of coat
   resistance between yellow/tip and blue/ground:
   | key | resistance, Ohm |
   |-----+-----------------|
   | +   | 5.575 k         |
   | >1  | 31.67 k         |
   | 11< | 46.28 k         |
   | 1<  | 19.96 k         |
   | -   | 10.018 k        |
** Current
   Connect F 2.5mm TRS to male 2.5mm of coat
   Connect F TRS to M TRS with fluke 8600A (uA) between yellow lines
   Connect M TRS to coat widget
   Connect coat widget to phone
   | key | current in uA |
   |-----+---------------|
   | +   | 106           |
   | >1  | 55.1          |
   | 11< | 43.21         |
   | 1<  | 70.12         |
   | -   | 91.39         |
** Voltage
   using scope: voltage between yellow/tip and blue/sleeve was 3V but fluctuated +-200mV

* Calculations
  With Vcc at 5V, and a 25k resistor to each rail with the coat keys inbetween:
  | Key     |    Rg |    Rv |    Rk | Ratio |
  |---------+-------+-------+-------+-------|
  | -       | 25000 | 25000 | 10000 |       |
  | rev     | 25000 | 25000 | 20000 |       |
  | play    | 25000 | 25000 | 46200 |       |
  | forward | 25000 | 25000 | 31600 |       |
